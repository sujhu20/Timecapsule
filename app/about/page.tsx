          <p className="mb-4">
            TimeCapsule is a digital platform that allows you to create and store personal messages,
            videos, photos, or documents to be delivered to specific people (or the public) at a future
            dateâ€”years, decades, or even centuries later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it as a digital time capsule that combines emotional storytelling, legacy
            preservation, and futuristic technology. It's a way to share your thoughts, wisdom,
            and memories with future generations.

          <p className="mb-4">
            TimeCapsule uses blockchain technology to ensure your capsules are tamper-proof
            and securely stored for decades or centuries. This means:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>Your content cannot be altered once it's sealed in a capsule</li>
            <li>Delivery dates cannot be tampered with</li>
            <li>Your capsules will survive even if our company doesn't</li>
            <li>Optional NFT (Non-Fungible Token) creation for unique, collectible capsules</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We've built TimeCapsule with longevity in mind, ensuring your messages will reach
            their intended recipients no matter how far in the future.
