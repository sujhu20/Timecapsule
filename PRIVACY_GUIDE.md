# Privacy Controls Guide

This document explains the privacy controls available in the TimeCapsule app and how to use them effectively.

## Understanding Capsule Privacy Settings

When creating a time capsule, you have three visibility options:

### 1. Private (Default)

- **Visibility**: Only visible to you (the creator) and specific recipients
- **Access control**: Only you and designated recipients can view the capsule
- **Discoverability**: Not discoverable by anyone else
- **Best for**: Personal memories, sensitive information, private messages

### 2. Recipients Only

- **Visibility**: Only visible to you and the recipients you specify
- **Access control**: Limited to creator and explicit recipients
- **Discoverability**: Not publicly discoverable
- **Best for**: Sharing with a specific group while maintaining privacy

### 3. Public

- **Visibility**: Visible to anyone using the platform
- **Access control**: Anyone can view the content once it's unlocked
- **Discoverability**: Appears in the public explore section
- **Best for**: Community time capsules, historical records, public challenges

## Additional Privacy Features

### Anonymous Creation

You can create capsules anonymously, hiding your identity from recipients. When enabled:
- Your name and profile information won't be attached to the capsule
- Recipients won't know who sent the capsule
- You'll still have access to manage the capsule

### Self-Destructing Capsules

For sensitive information, you can set a capsule to self-destruct after it's opened:
1. Enable "Self-destruct" when creating the capsule
2. Set a countdown timer (seconds, minutes, hours)
3. Once opened, the capsule will be permanently deleted after the timer expires

### Password Protection

Add an extra layer of security by requiring a password:
1. Enable "Password protection" when creating the capsule
2. Create a strong password
3. Share the password with recipients separately
4. Recipients will need both access to the capsule and the password to open it

## Best Practices

1. **Default to private**: Start with the most restrictive setting and only make public if necessary
2. **Regular review**: Periodically review your created capsules and their privacy settings
3. **Communicate off-platform**: Send passwords through a different communication channel
4. **Be cautious with public content**: Remember that public capsules can be viewed by anyone

## Privacy Technical Details

- All capsules are encrypted end-to-end using AES-256 encryption
- Content is encrypted before leaving your device
- Private keys never leave your device
- Public capsules are still encrypted, but accessible to more users
